            Sited in central Delhi it was placed where the Mughal emperors lived for many periods. Red Fort was a
            magnificent castle coated with precious jewels but the Britishers looted these precious jewels during their
            empowerment over India. </p>
          <p>Since Delhi was the capital of India until the British men shifted it, Red Fort was the control place for
            the whole nation. Built on the banks of Yamuna River, the walls of this magnificence fort have been built
            from 30 meters high Sandstone. It is supposed that Red Fort was made after 9 years of hard work of numerous
            masons for day and night during all seasons.</p>
          <p>The architecture of Red Fort is amazing and appreciable for its creations of five centuries ago without any
            modern-day technologies and methodologies. It is built with typical Mughal art and view. It has a Dewan-e-Am
            which is courtroom for all. The king held a hearing from common men about their complaints.

            The Red Fort is built right beside the Fort of Islam Shah Suri, namely- Shalimar Fort. He built it in 1546
            as his fortified Palace. Both the forts are combined together by a water channel, namely- Stream of
            Paradise, or Nahr-i-Behisht. </p>
          <p>Red Fort is not only a building but a true witness of the national movement of Indian freedom. Thus, it is
            a symbol of the great and golden history of India. So the Indian republic, as well as every citizen of
            India, have great affection and respect towards the Red fort. Undoubtedly it will always be a symbol of
            great Indian history. Also, it holds a special place in Indian history because Jawaharlal Nehru announced
            the independence of India from Red Fort. </p>
