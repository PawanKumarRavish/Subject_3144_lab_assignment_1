          <p>This 73-meter high tower was built by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak
            in the year 1193. Built after the defeat of Delhiâ€™s
            last Hindu ruler, the Qutub Minar was constructed to
            celebrate the Muslim supremacy in Delhi.
            It is the highest tower in India, with five
            levels and projecting balconies. The first three
            levels are made up of red sandstone and the last
            two of marble and sandstone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Qutub Minar has three different types of architectural
            styles. The construction of the minar was started by Aibak
            (who only made the basement). Later, Iltutmish added on
            three stories and then it was completed by Firoz Shah
            Tuglak, who constructed the last two stories.
            Quwwat-us-Islam Mosque, the first mosque ever to be built
            in India, is situated here.</p>

            Delhi is a city with an impressive and remarkable
            history. Standing as a witness to this interesting
            bygone era are the various monuments of Delhi. From
            the Old Fort to the Tughlaqabad area to the
            various tombs in the city, each one represents
            a separate period in the history of Delhi.</p><p>
            In the area of New Delhi, historical monuments
            cover mostly those that were built during the
            time of the British like the Parliament House,
            President's House, the India Gate etc.

            However, one thing that is common in all the monuments of
            Delhi is their architectural excellence. Be it the Red Fort
            built by Shah Jahan or the Parliament House designed by Edwin
            Lutyens,</p><p> each and every monument has an architectural beauty
            that leaves you mesmerized. All said and done, the
            magnificence of Delhi monuments cannot be fully described
            and you will have to visit them to really appreciate them
